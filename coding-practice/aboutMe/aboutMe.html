      <h2>Hey Y'all,</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Alexandra Schmitt. I am a recent graduate of the Towson
        University with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I currently
        looking for a job in web development, preferably front end development
        as that is what I am most familiar with, but I am studying and
        practicing backend as well. Currently, I am building a website for my
        cousin. She owns
        <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/thebutcherblock2019/?ref=page_internal"
          >Kim's Butcher Block</a
        >
        in Alabama and will be opening a second, larger store near Auburn
        University. In addition to the website, I will be helping her with her
        social media as well as with filming a few YouTube videos of her
        preparing a few meals to showcase her products.

        A little background on me... before returning to school for computer
        science, I moved to NYC to attend the Baking and Pastry Arts program at
        the Institute of Culinary Education, where I won the Top Toque Award for
        my class. After coming home to Baltimore, I worked as a cake decorator
        in Pariser's Bakery. Now I bake just for fun. I make a key lime
        cheesecake that is to die for.
      </p>

        I am a home-body for the most part. I taught myself how to knit,
        crochet, and quilt. During COVID, when we were all stuck at home, in
        addition to going to school, I turned the borders of my yard into
        beautiful gardens full of flowers and veggies. I have one dog. She is a
        beagle mix and her name is Hershey. I got her when I graduated
        elementary school, so she is an old lady now.

        One of my dreams is to spend time traveling the world. The first place I
        want to go is to Italy. After that, the world is my oyster. After
        traveling and experiencing new things, I want to buy ten-ish arces of
        land somewhere and start my own homestead. I plan to grow and preserve
        all my own food and have chickens, ducks, a milk cow, rabbits and maybe
        even pigs. And a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. That's a must!
